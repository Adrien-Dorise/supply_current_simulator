Supply current simulator based on an Arudino DUE board.
Moreover, it includes a fault generator based on tests perform on the SAM3X8E microcontroller.
It is used to simulate a great number of data set. These data sets are basis for machine learning algorithms.

This simulator is thoroughly described in this paper:
